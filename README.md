# From Role Cookbooks to Policyfiles (+ hab managed)

This repo has 3 examples of managing a small multi-tier platform.

1) [./acme_chef_repo_role_cookbooks](acme_chef_repo_role_cookbooks) demonstrates the use of the role cookbook pattern.
2) [./acme_chef_repo_policy_files](acme_chef_repo_policy_files) is a conversion of the previous example into the policy file pattern.
3) [./acme_chef_repo_hab_managed_chef](acme_chef_repo_hab_managed_chef) is a conversion of example 2 into the hab managed pattern.

The corresponding video of this is hosted [on this guru page](https://app.getguru.com/card/iRqRnzRT/Technical-Demo-of-Replacing-Role-Cookbooks-with-Policyfiles-OR-hab-managed-in-production) (currently accessible only to chef employees).
